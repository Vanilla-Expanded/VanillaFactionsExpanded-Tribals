	<description>Venture into the heart of primitive survival with Vanilla Factions Expanded - Tribals. Starting as unsophisticated wild men with nothing but fire at your disposal, face the harsh reality of the wilderness as you strive to form a new tribe. Experience the crucial tribal gatherings that unlock a pathway from basic doctoring to crafting simplistic weapons, all the way to unlocking the essence of culture, ideology, and beyond.

As you painstakingly progress through tech levels, cornerstone points become your vessel to choosing an ethos for your faction, granting notable enhancements to your people’s capabilities. The added challenge of survival makes every technological advancement feel like a monumental achievement.

This mod introduces new weapons, such as stakes and throwspikes, alongside communal structures like large fires and sitting spots, enriching both your early and endgame experience. Your journey from mere survival to ultratech advancements unfolds a narrative filled with trials, unity, and the essence of civilization.

I encourage you to subscribe to Vanilla Factions Expanded - Tribals if you’re looking to redefine your RimWorld experience from a raw, authentic beginning to a satisfying, technologically advanced ending. Your tale of humble beginnings to achieving ultratech glory is there for the taking.</description>
