    <description>Your small group has discovered fire, a stepping stone towards forming a tribe. Fire offers warmth, safety, and a chance to develop further. Yet, dangers abound in the wild, unknown world around you. You will have to learn how to perform basic tasks - from hunting and sowing, to doctoring and research. Work your way towards forming a tribe that can stand the test of time.\n\nWarning: You start without the ability to do basic tasks, such as sowing, doctoring and hunting - it is extremely difficult and anything can end your run.</description>

				<text>The world was tough and scary. Surviving each day was hard. But a small group of wild people decided to face it together, rather than alone.

They spent their days looking for food and shelter, and their nights fighting off the cold and danger.

Now, they are starting to form a simple group, helping each other to face the tough world ahead. They are taking their first steps towards becoming a tribe, trying to make life a little less hard for each other.</text>
